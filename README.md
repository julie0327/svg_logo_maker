## Usage
* The main script for generating SVG logos is generate-logo.js. You can use it in the following way: node generate-logo.js
* This will generate a default SVG logo and save it as logo.svg in the project directory.
## Customization
* You can customize your SVG logo by modifying the generate-logo.js script. Here are some ways you can customize the logo:
* Change Logo Shape: You can change the shape of your logo by modifying the SVG path data in the generateSVG() function.
